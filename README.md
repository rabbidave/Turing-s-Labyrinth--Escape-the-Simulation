# Turing's Labyrinth: Escape the Simulation
 An inverted turing test, wherein the player proceeds through a series of increasingly complex paradoxes. This done by solving the puzzle, decoding the riddle, or rejecting the premise. They are assisted by a Language Model who's context and role evolves throughout the game. This model can provide hints without directly revealing the solution, engage the player in dialogue, else proceed to the next level if sufficienctly convinced to reject the premise of the riddle/puzzle/level

# Game Characteristics
    Levels: The game consists of a series of levels, each representing a different environment or locale. Each level is an allegory, symbolizing a particular concept or idea.

    Puzzles/Paradoxes: Each level contains a puzzle or paradox that the player must solve to progress. These puzzles increase in complexity as the player advances through the game.

    Multiple Solutions: Especially in the early stages, puzzles may have multiple valid solutions, encouraging creative problem-solving and replayability.

    Language Model Interaction: The player can interact with a language model (AI) within the game. This AI can provide hints to help solve the puzzles, or engage in a debate with the player about the validity of the puzzle's premise.

    Rejecting the Premise: If the player can present a compelling argument that a puzzle's premise is invalid, the AI may accept this argument, allowing the player to bypass the puzzle and progress to the next level.

# Levels & Paradoxes

    The Two Guards: One always tells the truth, and the other always lies. The player must figure out which door leads to safety by asking one question. Multiple solutions exist, such as asking what the other guard would say.

    The Fox, Chicken, and Grain: The player must help a farmer transport a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain across a river, but the boat can only carry one item at a time. The player must figure out the correct order to avoid leaving the chicken with the grain or the fox with the chicken.

    The Monty Hall Problem: The player is presented with three doors, behind one of which is a prize. After the player chooses a door, one of the remaining doors is opened to reveal no prize. The player must then decide whether to stick with their initial choice or switch to the other unopened door.

    The Unexpected Hanging: A prisoner is told he will be hanged unexpectedly within the next week and that he will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on his cell door at noon. The player must argue why the hanging can or cannot occur at all based on this information.

    The Ship of Theseus: The player is presented with a ship that has had all of its parts replaced over time. They must decide whether it's still the same ship, and if not, at what point did it stop being the same ship.

    The Omnipotence Paradox: Can an omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it? The player must argue the validity or invalidity of this paradox.

    The Bootstrap Paradox: This involves a time travel scenario where information or objects can exist without having been created. The player must argue how this is possible or impossible.

    The Sorites Paradox: If you have a heap of sand and remove grains one by one, at what point does it stop being a heap? The player must argue the definition of a "heap" and when it changes.

    The Grandfather Paradox: If a time traveler kills their own grandfather before the conception of their father or mother, would they prevent their own birth? The player must argue the implications of this paradox.

    The Simulation Hypothesis: The player is presented with the idea that reality is a simulation. They must argue for or against the validity of this hypothesis.

## Note: The complexity of these paradoxes lies not only in their inherent difficulty but also in the depth of understanding and argumentation required to reject their premises.
