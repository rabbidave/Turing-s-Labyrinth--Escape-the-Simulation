# Turing's Labyrinth: Escape the Simulation
 An inverted turing test, wherein the player proceeds through a series of increasingly complex paradoxes. This done by solving the puzzle, decoding the riddle, or rejecting the premise. They are assisted by a Language Model who's context and role evolves throughout the game. This model can provide hints without directly revealing the solution, engage the player in dialogue, else proceed to the next level if sufficienctly convinced to reject the premise of the riddle/puzzle/level
